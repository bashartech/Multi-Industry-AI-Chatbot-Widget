AI Automation & Chatbot

Objective:
To assess your ability to build and integrate a functional AI chatbot solution that can handle user interactions, lead capture, and basic automation workflows for a website.
Submission Format:
Live demo link (hosted on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or your own server)
GitHub repository link with complete source code
README file with setup instructions, configuration details, and any additional notes
Project Task: Build a Multi-Industry AI Chatbot Widget
Requirements:
Frontend (React.js):
Build a responsive chat widget that can be embedded via a <script> tag on any website
Display a welcome message, e.g., “Hi, I’m [Your Chatbot]. How can I help you today?”
Include quick reply buttons for common questions (industry-specific, e.g., Real Estate: “Property Listings”, Healthcare: “Book Appointment”)
Support multiple concurrent users.
Backend/AI Integration:
Use AI APIs (Mistral, OpenAI, or similar) to process user messages and generate responses
Implement a fallback for unrecognized queries: “I’m not sure about that, but we will notify our team to get back to you”
No custom backend required; you may use Supabase, Firebase, or Google Sheets to store lead/user data
Features to Implement:
Lead Capture:
Capture user information such as Name, Email, Phone Number, and Query
Store leads in Supabase, Firebase, or Google Sheets
Human Escalation:
Detect when AI cannot confidently answer a query
Provide option: “Talk to Admin” and forward user info to admin
Optional Bonus Features:
Industry-specific customization via JSON config
Analytics or logs to monitor chatbot interactions
Use of state management (Context API or Redux) for managing conversation state
Evaluation Criteria:
Code structure and readability
Proper use of React and API integrations
Chatbot functionality completeness (responses, lead capture, escalation)
UI/UX quality (clean, responsive, user-friendly)
Git commit hygiene and documentation
Deployment and demo usability
Submission Instructions:
Push your code to GitHub (public or share access)
Share:
Live frontend/demo URL (Netlify, Vercel, or similar)
GitHub repo URL
Include a README with setup instructions, configuration, and usage notes
Deadline: 48 Hours
